In this article, we have studied the problem of scalable enumeration of all subgraph isomorphisms in a graph database. We took the graph decomposition process of the \textit{Network Algorithm} first proposed by  Messmer and Bunke \cite{messmer_bunke2000} and extended it from processing only induced subgraph isomorphism to include subgraph isomorphism. The extended Algorithm  likely suits more research oriented as well as real world  problems.
We proposed improvements on \textit{Network Algorithm} enable it to process larger query or a larger graph database while maintaining good performance.
We did this mainly by restraining the rapid increase in running time due to the creation of disconnected graphs in the DAG during query processing.

For small graphs our method shows performance that is indistinguishable from that is Messmer's \textit{Network Algorithm}. We have shown that for large
query graph and for large database our method is an order of magnitude faster than the \textit{Network Algorithm} or VF2. This is in spite of the fact that, unlike
VF2 algorithm, our algorithm processes enumeration of all isomorphic subgraphs, while VF2 will stop as soon as an isomorphic subgraph is detected in the database.
