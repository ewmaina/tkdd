abstract={A new approach to the problem of graph isomorphism detection base on decision tree is proposed. It is based on the approach proposed by B. T. Messmer and H. Bunke. If the time needed for preprocessing is neglected, the computational complexity of their approach is only polynomial in the number of input graph vertices. However, the decision tree is of exponential size. It's not practical for the graphs with many vertices. We introduce the vertex invariants to partition the matrix of the input graph before graph isomorphism detection. It can remarkably reduces the size of the decision tree and keeps the same time complexity. Practical experiments with randomly generated graphs were given to prove that. © 2010 IEEE.},

abstract={In the field of structural pattern recognition, graphs provide us with a common and powerful way to represent objects. Yet, one of the main drawbacks of graph representation is that the computation of standard graph similarity measures is exponential in the number of involved nodes. Hence, such computations are feasible for small graphs only. The present paper considers the problem of graph isomorphism, i.e. checking two graphs for identity. A novel approach for the efficient computation of graph isomorphism is presented. The proposed algorithm is based on bipartite graph matching by means of Munkres' algorithm. The algorithmic framework is suboptimal in the sense of possibly rejecting pairs of graphs without making a decision. As an advantage, however, it offers polynomial runtime. In experiments on two TC-15 graph sets we demonstrate substantial speedups of our proposed method over several standard procedures for graph isomorphism, such as Ullmann's method, the VF2 algorithm, and Nauty. Furthermore, although the computational framework for isomorphism is suboptimal, we show that the proposed algorithm rejects only very few pairs of graphs. © 2009 Springer Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={In structural pattern recognition, a major drawback of graph based representation is the lack of algorithmic tools. To overcome this lack, we embed graphs in vector spaces by means of prototype selection and graph edit distance, thus making them available to all algorithms of statistical pattern recognition that operate on feature vectors. In previous work a similar procedure was applied. However, the only classifier used within this framework was Support Vector Machine (SVM). In the present paper, we significantly extend the scope of the previous work and present an experimental study where, in addition to SVM, a number of other well established classifiers from statistical pattern recognition are used for graph classification. On a total of five different graph data sets of diverse nature it is demonstrated that the proposed graph embedding in conjunction with standard classifiers from statistical pattern recognition has great potential to outperform classification methods applied in the original graph domain. © 2008 IEEE.},

Consequently, the use of graph based representation for data mining has become a promising approach to extracting novel and useful knowledge from relational data. In order to check whether a certain graph occurs, as a substructure, within a larger database graph, the widely studied concept of subgraph isomorphism can be used. However, this conventional approach is rather limited. In the present paper the concept of subgraph isomorphism is substantially extended such that it can cope with don't care symbols, variables, and constraints.

In this paper we propose a new approach to graph classification by embedding graphs in real vector spaces. This approach allows us to apply advanced classification tools while retaining the high representational power of graphs. The basic idea of our approach is to regard the edit distances of a given graph g to a set of training graphs as a vectorial description of g. Once a graph has been transformed into a vector, different dimensionality reduction algorithms are applied such that redundancies are eliminated. To this reduced vectorial data representation, pattern classification algorithms can be applied. Through various experimental results we show that the proposed vector space embedding and subsequent classification with the reduced vectors outperform the classification algorithms in the original graph domain. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2007.},

abstract={Recently, an emerging trend of representing objects by graphs can be observed. As a matter of fact, graphs offer a versatile alternative to feature vectors in pattern recognition, machine learning and data mining. However, the space of graphs contains almost no mathematical structure, and consequently, there is a lack of suitable methods for graph classification. Graph kernels, a novel class of algorithms for pattern analysis, offer an elegant solution to this problem. Graph kernels aim at bridging the gap between statistical and symbolic object representations. In the present paper we propose a general approach to transforming graphs into n-dimensional real vector spaces by means of graph edit distance. As a matter of fact, this approach results in a novel family of graph kernels making a wide range of kernel machines applicable for graphs.

In the present paper we introduce a general approach to building structural classifier ensembles, i.e. classifiers that make use of graphs as representation formalism and include strings and trees as special cases. The proposed methodology is based on graph embedding in real vector spaces by means of prototype selection. This selection is performed randomized n times such that the procedure leads to n different graph embeddings. Hence, a classifier can be trained for each embedding and the results of the individual classifiers can be combined in an appropriate way. In the present paper we take into account that not only the prototypes themselves but also their number has a critical impact on the classification accuracy in the resulting vector space. In several experimental results we make investigations on the classification accuracy of the resulting classifier ensembles and compare them with single classifier systems. ©2007 IEEE.},

We will show that this approach can be improved if the decision about a gap is not only made in terms of a threshold, but also depends on the context of that gap, i.e. if the relative sizes of the surrounding gaps are taken into consideration. For this purpose, we propose to build a structure tree of the text line, whose nodes represent possible word candidates. Such a tree is traversed in a top-down manner to find the nodes that correspond to words of the text line. Experiments with different gap metrics as well as threshold types show that the new method can yield significant improvements over conventional word extraction methods. © 2005 IEEE.},

To reduce the influence of that factor, an approach based on machine learning techniques is proposed in this paper. Graphs are represented using feature vectors.

Moreover, computing the median of a set of graphs is only linear in the cardinality of the set. In a series of experiments, it is demonstrated that the proposed algorithms run very fast in practice.

abstract={Many powerful methods for intelligent data analysis have become available in the fields of machine learning and data mining. However, almost all of these methods are based on the assumption that the objects under consideration are represented in terms of feature vectors, or collections of attribute values. In the present paper we argue that symbolic representations, such as strings, trees or graphs, have a representational power that is significantly higher than the representational power of feature vectors. On the other hand, operations on these data structure that are typically needed in data mining and machine learning are more involved than their counterparts on feature vectors. However, recent progress in graph matching and related areas has led to many new practical methods that seem to be very promising for a wide range of applications.},

abstract={Graphs are a powerful and universal data structure useful in various subfields of science and engineering. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm for subgraph isomorphism detection from a set of a priori known model graphs to an input graph that is given online. The new approach is based on a compact representation of the model graphs that is computed offline. Subgraphs that appear multiple times within the same or within different model graphs are represented only once, thus reducing the computational effort to detect them in an input graph. In the extreme case where all model graphs are highly similar, the run-time of the new algorithm becomes independent of the number of model graphs. Both a theoretical complexity analysis and practical experiments characterizing the performance of the new approach will be given.},

abstract={The computation of generalized median graphs (the graph with the smallest average edit distance to all graphs in a given set of graphs) is highly computationally complex. As a matter of fact, it is exponential in the number of nodes of the union of all graphs under consideration. Thus, the generalized median graph computation problem seems to be a suitable and challenging testbed for a comparison of combinatorial search and genetic algorithms. Two solutions are described in this paper. The first is an exact algorithm based on combinatorial search, while the second is a genetic algorithm. Both approaches are compared to each other in a series of experiments.},

abstract={A powerful and universal data structure with applications in various subfields of science and engineering is graphs. In computer vision and image analysis, graphs are often used for the representation of structured objects. For example, if the problem is to recognize instances of known objects in an image, then often models, or prototypes, of the known objects are represented by means of graphs and stored in a database. The unknown objects in the input image are extracted by means of suitable preprocessing and segmentation algorithms, and represented by graphs that are analogous to the model graphs. Thus, the problem of object recognition is transformed into a graph matching problem. In this paper, it is assumed that there is an input graph that is given on-line, and a number of model, or prototype, graphs that are known a priori. We present a new approach to subgraph isomorphism detection which is based on a compact representation of the model graphs that is computed off-line. Subgraphs that appear multiple times within the same or within different model graphs are represented only once, thus reducing the computational effort to detect them in an input graph. In the extreme case where all model graphs are highly similar, the run time of the new algorithm becomes independent of the number of model graphs. We also describe an extension of this method to error-correcting graph matching. Furthermore, an approach to subgraph isomorphism detection based on decision trees is proposed. A decision tree is generated from the models in an off-line phase. This decision tree can be used for subgraph isomorphism detection. The time needed for decision tree traversal is only polynomial in terms of the number of nodes of the input graph. Moreover, the time complexity of the decision tree traversal is completely independent on the number of model graphs, regardless of their similarity. However, the size of the decision tree is exponential in the number of nodes of the models. To cut down the space complexity of the decision tree, some pruning strategies are discussed.},
