In this section, we propose an expansion of Messmer's method to subgraph query with some improvements, mentioned previously in section 4.2.
We the describe the process of dealing with induced subgraph query.

We now describe the algorithms of subgraph query and induced subgraph query in detail.

The algorithms consist of two parts. The first part consists of the construction of a dynamic acyclic graph $DAG$ that stores graphs in its nodes 
in a recursively decomposed form. In the $DAG$ there is directed a edge from a parent to a child. The second part consists of the process of 
detecting subgraph isomorphisms using $DAG$ constructed in previous part. The $DAG$ is the central graph structure for this work and is considered 
a global variant throughout the algorithms. 

First, we propose an expansion of Messmer's method to subgraph query with some improvements.

\subsection{Expansion to Subgraph Isomorphism Query with Improvements}
The \textit{Network Algorithm} only supports induced subgraph isomorphism query. However, in practice,  subgraph isomorphism query is more likely to suit
real world problems so we reformulate the \textit{Network Algorithm} to process subgraph isomorphism query.
In this subsection, we describe the details of the expansion of the \textit{Network Algorithm} to subgraph query and also propose some addition improvements.
Some of our improvements applied to subgraph query are also applicable to induced subgraph queries which is addressed in the next subsection.
For these algorithms, we use parenthesis such as (induced) subgraph to seperate the two processes. We first discuss the subgraph isomorphism so ignore the 
inside of the parentheses throughout this subsection.

\subsubsection{DAG Construction}
The $DAG$ is the main data structure for the database construction and query processing. In this section we outline the steps required to construct 
the $DAG$ and the use of the $DAG$ to process queries. First the algorithm for the construction of the DAG is show in Algorithm \ref{alg:alg101} below.

%%\label{insertion}
Insert(Algorithm\ref{alg:alg1}) outlines the dynamic insertion algorithm for $DAG$. In order to construct $DAG$, we can insert graphs in a graph database 
sequentially.

While constructing $DAG$, the algorithm maintains a rule that graph $g$ directs its two (induced) subgraphs.
The exception being that $g$ will have no children if $g$ is a singleton graph.
The information about the shared vertices and the mappings between a parent and children must be stored with a parent-child relationship.

First, the algorithm searches $g_i$'s all (induced) subgraphs in $DAG$(line 3-7).
The discovered (induced) subgraphs are inserted to a priority queue $PriorityQueue$.
For this (induced) subgraph search, SubgraphQuery (Algorithm\ref{alg:alg5}) explained in the latter section can be used.

If it is discovered that  $s$, the graph at the top of the priority queue is isomorphic to $g_i$,
we replace them by setting a directed edge from the parent of $g_i$ to $s$(line 9-11).
The existence of graph isomorphism is easily assured by checking whether $E(g_i)$ is equals to $E(s)$ or not.

In most cases, a (induced) subgraph $s$ of $g_i$ will be discovered. In that case, the algorithm calculates $s_{rest} = g_i -_{(induced)} s$ and $g_i$ is decomposed into the $s$ and the rest graph $s_{rest}$.
If $s_{rest}$ is connected, $s_{rest}$ is inserted to $DAG$ recursively(line 14-15).
There is the case that $s_{rest}$ is disconnected.
This result violates the requirement that a connected graph is decomposed into two connected graphs.
When faced with the violation the algorithm abandons this result and tests the subtractions of all (induced) subgraph isomorphisms of all (induced) subgraphs until $s_{rest}$ becomes connected.

The order in which the  (induced) subgraph are tested for subtraction relies on how we set the priority on $PriorityQueue$.
The larger a graph is, the more costly it is to compute the (induced) subgraph isomorphisms of the graph therefore we make $PriorityQueue$ precede larger graphs
so a larger graph is shared.

If no (induced) subgraph is discovered or no (induced) subgraph can make $s_{rest}$ connected, $g_i$ is decomposed by the RandomPartition (Algorithm\ref{alg:alg2}).
The decomposed (induced) subgraphs are inserted to $DAG$ recursively(line 26-33).
In the case that $g_i$ is disconnected, $g_i$ is decomposed by distributing its components to two children so that decomposed graphs finally become connected gr
phs(line 28-29).

The \textit{Network Algorithm} decomposes a graph by distributing vertices randomly and creating subgraphs which induced by distributed vertices.
This decomposition possibly creates disconnected subgraphs composed of many tiny components.
The number of matchings resulting from a lerge numer of such disconnected graphs to a query graph can easily skyrocket.
We need to make sure that the decomposed subgraphs are connected to avoid this problem.

The \textit{Network Algorithm} decomposes a graph by cutting edges for induced subgraph query.
We  now  focus on the subgraphs.
In order to allow a subtraction of an arbitrary subgraph from a graph we have to decompose a graph by sharing vertices.

RandomPartition (Algorithm\ref{alg:alg2}) decompose a connected graph $g$ into two connected subgraphs.
First, the algorithm distributes edges randomly.
If at least one subgraph is disconnected, two subgraphs transfer their components to the other side.
A transition of a component connects components of the other side because $g$ is connected.
So the algorithm repeats the transitions until both subgraphs become connected.
We can not decompose a single edge any further by sharing vertices.
As a result the algorithm cannot deal with a singleton graph or a disconnected graph which includes one or more isolated vertices.
We decompose a single edge in the manner of cutting edges.

\begin{algorithm}
\caption{RandomPartition}

\IF{$g$ is composed of a single edge $e = (v_1, v_2)$}
	\STATE insert $v_1,v_2$ to $s_1,s_2$ respectively
\ELSE
	\STATE $(s_1, s_2)$ RandomPartitionInduced($g$)
	\WHILE{either $s_1$ or $s_2$ is disconnected}
		\IF{both $s_1$ and $s_2$ is disconnected}
			\STATE move minimum component of the larger graph to the other side
		\ELSE
			\STATE move minimum component of the disconnected graph to the other side
		\ENDIF
	\ENDWHILE
\ENDIF
\RETURN $(s_1,s_2)$
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

\subsubsection{Query Processing}
There are two types of query processing to the graph database. The induced graph query and the Non induced graph query. In this section we outline the algorithm
 for both types of processing.
Search(Algorithm \ref{alg:alg4}) outlines the procedure for the (induced) subgraph isomorphism query processing.
SubgraphQuery (Algorithm \ref{alg:alg5}) can calculate the (induced) subgraph isomorphisms from any node in $DAG$ to a query graph $q$.
So we can accomplish (induced) subgraph isomorphism query by processing SubgraphQuery with all model graphs as input.

In the procedure of the (induced) subgraph search, all nodes in $DAG$ are supposed to be marked with one of three different tags, $alive$, $dead$ or $unsolved$.
Those tags express the conditions that (a) have been matched already with the query graph and (induced) subgraph isomorphisms exists, (b) have been matched alre
ady and (induced) subgraph isomorphisms do not exist, (c) have not been matched yet respectively.
At the beginning, all nodes in $DAG$ are marked as $unsolved$.

SubgraphQuery works recursively.
If the input graph $g$ have been already marked $alive$ or $dead$, there is nothing to do and the algorithm only returns subgraph isomorphisms $F$ that is supposed to have been already calculated.

If $g$ is a singleton graph, there are no children.
Then, SubgraphQuery calls AssignVertex(Algorithm\ref{alg:alg6}).
AssignVertex simply searches the occurrences of the label of the single vertices in a query graph $q$.

If $g$ marked $unsolved$, we check (induced) subgraph isomorphisms of its children by using SubgraphQuery recursively.
Now we can exploit the useful fact that if a child is not a (induced) subgraph of a query graph, its parent also not a (induced) subgraph of the query graph.
First, in order to remove redundancies we check the tags of children of $g$ before we call SubgraphQuery. 
Next, we call SubgraphQuery for $g$'s children.
If at least one child tagged $dead$ or returns empty sets, we can also assure that $g$ is $dead$  
Only in the case that both of the children return $alive$, we have to calculate the (induced) subgraph isomorphisms from $g$ to $q$ by calling Combine.

\begin{algorithm}[t]
\caption{Search}
\label{alg:alg4}

\RETURN $Z$
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

		\IF{$c_1$ or $c_2$ is already marked $dead$}
			\STATE mark $g$ $dead$
		\ELSIF{SubgraphQuery$(c_1,q) \neq \emptyset$ \\ or SubgraphQuery$(c_2,q) \neq \emptyset$}
			\STATE mark $g$ $dead$
		\ELSE
			\STATE $F :=$ Combine(Induced)$(g,q)$
		\ENDIF
	\ENDIF
	\IF{$F \neq \emptyset$}
		\STATE mark $g$ $alive$
	\ELSE
		\STATE mark $g$ $dead$
	\ENDIF
\ELSE
	\STATE let $F$ be the calculated subgraph isomorphisms from $g$ to $q$
\ENDIF
\RETURN $F$
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

$DAG$ is designed such that a graph $g$ can make use of its children's (induced) subgraph isomorphisms to $q$ in order to reduce the computational effort of calculating (induced) subgraph isomorphisms from $g$ to $q$.
For this purpose, a procedure for the combination of induced subgraph isomorphisms is required.

Combine (Algorithm\ref{alg:alg11}) is the procedure for the combination of subgraph isomorphisms.
When Combine is called with $g$ as input, the subgraph isomorphisms $F_1, F_2$ from its children $c_1, c_2$ to $q$ is supposed to be already calculated.
In the case that $g$ is connected, there are two conditions that must be satisfied to combine two functions $f_1 \in F_1, f_2 \in F_2$.
First, it must be ensured that each corresponding common vertices is mapped correctly onto same vertex(line 11).
Second, the images of uncommon vertices of $f_1$ and $f_2$ must be disjoint(line 12).
Otherwise, the combination of $f_1$ and $f_2$ will not be injective function.
If $g$ is disconnected, we only need to check one condition that the images of $f_1$ and $f_2$ is disjoint(line 20).
We define the combination of (induced) subgraph isomorphisms as follows
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eq:eq1}
f(v) = \left\{
\begin{array}{l}
f_1(p_1(v)) (p_1(v) \in V(c_1))\\
f_2(p_2(v)) (p_2(v) \in V(c_2))
\end{array}
\right.
\end{eqnarray} 
Combine checks all pair of the two functions.
If a pair satisfied those conditions, Combine calculates and returns it.

Combine can not deal with a graph that is not decomposed in the manner of sharing vertices.
So if a inputed graph is composed of a single edge, Combine calls Combine (induced) (Algorithm\ref{alg:alg8})
that deals with graphs decomposed in the manner of cutting edges.

	\IF{$\mu(v)= \mu_q (v_q)$}
		\STATE add $f(v) = v_q$ to $F$
	\ENDIF
\ENDFOR
\RETURN $F$

\subsection{Induced Subgraph Query}
The improvements proposed in previous subsection is also efficient for induced subgraph query.
In this subsection, we explain the details of our induced subgraph query.
Many of algorithms of induced subgraph query are same as that of subgraph query.
If we reference the former subsection, take the insides of the parenthesises into consideration.

\subsubsection{DAG Construction}
The procedure of construction of $DAG$ and dynamic insertion algorithm are almost identical to the case of subgraph query.
However, there are some differences which we explain here..
First, a parent-child relationship must store the information about the cut edges instead of the shared vertices because of the difference of the way of decomposing a graph.
Second, the existence of a graph isomorphism is assured by checking whether $V(g_i)$ is equal to $V(s)$ or not.

In order to decompose an arbitrary graph into two smaller induced subgraphs we have to decompose a graph in the manner of cutting edges.
 We need a procedure for decomposing a connected graph randomly that is specific to that manner.

RandomPartitionInduced (Algorithm\ref{alg:alg15}) decomposed a connected graph into two connected induced subgraphs.
First, the algorithm initialize two induced subgraphs by distributed vertices and the edges that the vertices induce.
Then, two subgraphs transfer their minimum components until they become connected, a process similar to the one in thes algorithm for subgraph query.

The decomposition of a disconnected graph is identical to the one for subgraph query.

\begin{algorithm}
\caption{RandomPartitionInduced}
\label{alg:alg15}
\begin{algorithmic}
\STATE Input: Graph $g$
\STATE Output: A pair of graphs $(s_1, s_2)$
\end{algorithmic}
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\STATE let $s_1 := \emptyset$, $s_2 := \emptyset$
\STATE distribute vertices of $g$ randomly to $s_1$ or $s_2$ in half
\STATE set edges induced by distributed vertices to $s_1$ and $s_2$ 
\REPEAT
	\IF{both $s_1$ and $s_2$ is disconnected}
		\STATE move minimum component of the larger graph to the other side
	\ELSE
		\STATE move minimum component of the disconnected graph to the other side
	\ENDIF
	\STATE reset edges induced by distributed vertices to $s_1$ and $s_2$ 
\UNTIL{both $s_1$ and $s_2$ is connected}
\RETURN $(s_1,s_2)$
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

\subsubsection{Query Processing}
The search processing algorithms for non-induced subgraphs are also applicable to induced subgraphs;
Search(Algorithm\ref{alg:alg4}), SubgraphQuery (Algorithm\ref{alg:alg5}) and AssignVertex(Algorithm\ref{alg:alg6}) are also applicable to induced subgraph query.

Due to the difference in the method of decomposition, we need a new procedure for the combining the induced subgraph isomorphisms. 
CombineInduced(Algorithm\ref{alg:alg8}) outlines that procedure.
If CombineInduced is called with graph $g$ as input, the sets of induced subgraph isomorphisms $F_1, F_2$ from its children $c_1, c_2$ to the query graph are to be already calculated.
There are two conditions that must be satisfied to CombineInduced two functions $f_1 \in F_1, f_2 \in F_2$.
First, there must exist edges in the query graph correspond to cut edges and vice versa(line 7).
Second, we must ensure that the images of $f_1$ and $f_2$ are disjoint(line 8), otherwise the combination of $f_1$ and $f_2$ will not be injective function.
CombineInduced checks all pairs of the two functions and returns the sets of its unions that satisfy these conditions.

\subsection{Usability with Graph Pruning}
The \textit{Network Algorithm}  cannot process local query efficiently (i.e. In the case that you want to know subgraph isomorphisms from only some graphs in a graph database to a query graph, the \textit{Network Algorithm} calculates subgraph isomorphisms for all the nodes in $DAG$).
In contrast our recursive formulation of the \textit{Network Algorithm} only checks the relevant descendants of selected nodes and this allows us to solve local queries more efficiently.

One result of the support of local query is that we can make use of some graph pruning techniques. Let us consider a simple example \textit{label check}. If a graph database stores the numeric labels of attributed graphs, for some graphs it can be easily determined when they have no subgraph isomorphisms to a query graph just by comparing the attributes of the graph with those of the query graph.
In this we can efficiently reduce the candidates graphs for the answer.
Consequently, by pruning graphs in advance, we can significantly reduce the related procesing time.
