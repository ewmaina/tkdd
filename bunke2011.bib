abstract={A new approach to the problem of graph isomorphism detection base on decision tree is proposed. It is based on the approach proposed by B. T. Messmer and H. Bunke. If the time needed for preprocessing is neglected, the computational complexity of their approach is only polynomial in the number of input graph vertices. However, the decision tree is of exponential size. It's not practical for the graphs with many vertices. We introduce the vertex invariants to partition the matrix of the input graph before graph isomorphism detection. It can remarkably reduces the size of the decision tree and keeps the same time complexity. Practical experiments with randomly generated graphs were given to prove that. © 2010 IEEE.},

abstract={In the field of structural pattern recognition, graphs provide us with a common and powerful way to represent objects. Yet, one of the main drawbacks of graph representation is that the computation of standard graph similarity measures is exponential in the number of involved nodes. Hence, such computations are feasible for small graphs only. The present paper considers the problem of graph isomorphism, i.e. checking two graphs for identity. A novel approach for the efficient computation of graph isomorphism is presented. The proposed algorithm is based on bipartite graph matching by means of Munkres' algorithm. The algorithmic framework is suboptimal in the sense of possibly rejecting pairs of graphs without making a decision. As an advantage, however, it offers polynomial runtime. In experiments on two TC-15 graph sets we demonstrate substantial speedups of our proposed method over several standard procedures for graph isomorphism, such as Ullmann's method, the VF2 algorithm, and Nauty. Furthermore, although the computational framework for isomorphism is suboptimal, we show that the proposed algorithm rejects only very few pairs of graphs. © 2009 Springer Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={In structural pattern recognition, a major drawback of graph based representation is the lack of algorithmic tools. To overcome this lack, we embed graphs in vector spaces by means of prototype selection and graph edit distance, thus making them available to all algorithms of statistical pattern recognition that operate on feature vectors. In previous work a similar procedure was applied. However, the only classifier used within this framework was Support Vector Machine (SVM). In the present paper, we significantly extend the scope of the previous work and present an experimental study where, in addition to SVM, a number of other well established classifiers from statistical pattern recognition are used for graph classification. On a total of five different graph data sets of diverse nature it is demonstrated that the proposed graph embedding in conjunction with standard classifiers from statistical pattern recognition has great potential to outperform classification methods applied in the original graph domain. © 2008 IEEE.},

abstract={Graph based data representation offers a convenient possibility to represent entities, their attributes, and their relationships to other entities. Consequently, the use of graph based representation for data mining has become a promising approach to extracting novel and useful knowledge from relational data. In order to check whether a certain graph occurs, as a substructure, within a larger database graph, the widely studied concept of subgraph isomorphism can be used. However, this conventional approach is rather limited. In the present paper the concept of subgraph isomorphism is substantially extended such that it can cope with don't care symbols, variables, and constraints. Our novel approach leads to a powerful graph matching methodology which can be used for advanced graph based data mining. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={Graphs are a convenient representation formalism for structured objects, but they suffer from the fact that only a few algorithms for graph classification and clustering exist. In this paper we propose a new approach to graph classification by embedding graphs in real vector spaces. This approach allows us to apply advanced classification tools while retaining the high representational power of graphs. The basic idea of our approach is to regard the edit distances of a given graph g to a set of training graphs as a vectorial description of g. Once a graph has been transformed into a vector, different dimensionality reduction algorithms are applied such that redundancies are eliminated. To this reduced vectorial data representation, pattern classification algorithms can be applied. Through various experimental results we show that the proposed vector space embedding and subsequent classification with the reduced vectors outperform the classification algorithms in the original graph domain. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2007.},

abstract={The field of statistical pattern recognition is characterized by the use of feature vectors for pattern representation, while strings or, more generally, graphs are prevailing in structural pattern recognition. In this paper we aim at bridging the gap between the domain of feature based and graph based object representation. We propose a general approach for transforming graphs into n-dimensional real vector spaces by means of prototype selection and graph edit distance computation. This method establishes the access to the wide range of procedures based on feature vectors without loosing the representational power of graphs. Through various experimental results we show that the proposed method, using graph embedding and classification in a vector space, outperforms the tradional approach based on k-nearest neighbor classification in the graph domain. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2007.},

abstract={Recently, an emerging trend of representing objects by graphs can be observed. As a matter of fact, graphs offer a versatile alternative to feature vectors in pattern recognition, machine learning and data mining. However, the space of graphs contains almost no mathematical structure, and consequently, there is a lack of suitable methods for graph classification. Graph kernels, a novel class of algorithms for pattern analysis, offer an elegant solution to this problem. Graph kernels aim at bridging the gap between statistical and symbolic object representations. In the present paper we propose a general approach to transforming graphs into n-dimensional real vector spaces by means of graph edit distance. As a matter of fact, this approach results in a novel family of graph kernels making a wide range of kernel machines applicable for graphs. With several experimental results we prove the robustness and flexibility of our new method and show that our approach outperforms a standard graph classification method on several graph data sets of diverse nature. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2007.},

abstract={In this paper we present a new multiple classifier system (MCS) for recognizing notes written on a whiteboard. This MCS combines one off-line and two on-line handwriting recognition systems derived from previous work. The recognizers are all based on Hidden Markov Models but vary in the way of preprocessing and normalization. To combine the output sequences of the recognizers, we incrementally align the word sequences using a standard string matching algorithm. For deriving the final decision a voting strategy is applied. With the combination we could increase the system performance over the best individual recognizer by about 2%. © 2007 IEEE.},

abstract={The motivation of classifier ensembles is that errors of an individual classifier can often be compensated by the other ensemble members. In the present paper we introduce a general approach to building structural classifier ensembles, i.e. classifiers that make use of graphs as representation formalism and include strings and trees as special cases. The proposed methodology is based on graph embedding in real vector spaces by means of prototype selection. This selection is performed randomized n times such that the procedure leads to n different graph embeddings. Hence, a classifier can be trained for each embedding and the results of the individual classifiers can be combined in an appropriate way. In the present paper we take into account that not only the prototypes themselves but also their number has a critical impact on the classification accuracy in the resulting vector space. In several experimental results we make investigations on the classification accuracy of the resulting classifier ensembles and compare them with single classifier systems. ©2007 IEEE.},

abstract={Word extraction from handwritten text lines usually involves the calculation of a line specific threshold which separates the gaps between words from the gaps inside the words in that line. We will show that this approach can be improved if the decision about a gap is not only made in terms of a threshold, but also depends on the context of that gap, i.e. if the relative sizes of the surrounding gaps are taken into consideration. For this purpose, we propose to build a structure tree of the text line, whose nodes represent possible word candidates. Such a tree is traversed in a top-down manner to find the nodes that correspond to words of the text line. Experiments with different gap metrics as well as threshold types show that the new method can yield significant improvements over conventional word extraction methods. © 2005 IEEE.},

abstract={Structural pattern representations, especially graphs, have advantages over feature vectors, However, they also suffer from a number of disadvantages, for example, their high computational complexity. Moreover, we observe that in the field of statistical pattern recognition a number of powerful concepts emerged recently that have no equivalent counterpart in the domain of structural pattern recognition yet. Examples include multiple classifier systems and kernel methods. In this paper, we survey a number of recent developments that may be suitable to overcome some of the current limitations of graph based representations in pattern recognition. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2005.},

abstract={The interpretation of natural scenes, generally so obvious and effortless for humans, still remains a challenge in computer vision. We propose in this article to design binary classifiers capable to recognise some generic image categories. Images are represented by graphs of regions and we define a graph edit distance to measure the dissimilarity between them. Furthermore a feature selection step is used to pick in the image the most meaningful regions for a given category and thus have a compact and appropriate graph representation. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2005.},

abstract={Graphs are a powerful representation formalism for structural data. They are, however, very expensive from the computational point of view. In pattern recognition it is often necessary to match an unknown sample against a database of candidate patterns. In this process, however, the size of the database is introduced as an additional factor into the overall complexity of the matching process. To reduce the influence of that factor, an approach based on machine learning techniques is proposed in this paper. Graphs are represented using feature vectors. Based on these vectors a decision tree is built to index the database. The decision tree allows at runtime to eliminate a number of graphs from the database as possible matching candidates.},

abstract={A special class of graphs is introduced in this paper. The graphs belonging to this class are characterised by the existence of unique node labels. A number of matching algorithms for graphs with unique node labels are developed. It is shown that problems such as graph isomorphism, subgraph isomorphism, maximum common subgraph (MCS) and graph edit distance (GED) have a computational complexity that is only quadratic in the number of nodes. Moreover, computing the median of a set of graphs is only linear in the cardinality of the set. In a series of experiments, it is demonstrated that the proposed algorithms run very fast in practice. The considered class makes the matching of large graphs, consisting of thousands of nodes, computationally tractable. We also discuss an application of the considered class of graphs and related matching algorithms to the classification and detection of abnormal events in computer networks. © Springer-Verlag London Limited 2004.},

abstract={In this paper we describe methods of performing data mining on web documents, where the web document content is represented by graphs. We show how traditional clustering and classification methods, which usually operate on vector representations of data, can be extended to work with graph-based data. Specifically, we give graphtheoretic extensions of the k-Nearest Neighbors classification algorithm and the k-means clustering algorithm that process graphs, and show how the retention of structural information can lead to improved performance over the case of the vector model approach. We introduce several different types of web document representations that utilize graphs and compare their performance for clustering and classification. © Springer-Verlag 2004.},

abstract={Many powerful methods for intelligent data analysis have become available in the fields of machine learning and data mining. However, almost all of these methods are based on the assumption that the objects under consideration are represented in terms of feature vectors, or collections of attribute values. In the present paper we argue that symbolic representations, such as strings, trees or graphs, have a representational power that is significantly higher than the representational power of feature vectors. On the other hand, operations on these data structure that are typically needed in data mining and machine learning are more involved than their counterparts on feature vectors. However, recent progress in graph matching and related areas has led to many new practical methods that seem to be very promising for a wide range of applications.},

abstract={Graphs are a powerful and universal data structure useful in various subfields of science and engineering. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm for subgraph isomorphism detection from a set of a priori known model graphs to an input graph that is given online. The new approach is based on a compact representation of the model graphs that is computed offline. Subgraphs that appear multiple times within the same or within different model graphs are represented only once, thus reducing the computational effort to detect them in an input graph. In the extreme case where all model graphs are highly similar, the run-time of the new algorithm becomes independent of the number of model graphs. Both a theoretical complexity analysis and practical experiments characterizing the performance of the new approach will be given.},

abstract={A new approach to the problem of graph and subgraph isomorphism detection from an input graph to a database of model graphs is proposed in this paper. It is based on a preprocessing step in which the model graphs are used to create a decision tree. At run time, subgraph isomorphisms are detected by means of decision tree traversal. If we neglect the time needed for preprocessing, the computational complexity of the new graph algorithm is only polynomial in the number of input graph vertices. In particular, it is independent of the number of model graphs and the number of edges in any of the graphs. However, the decision tree is of exponential size. Several pruning techniques which aim at reducing the size of the decision tree are presented. A computational complexity analysis of the new method is given and its behavior is studied in a number of practical experiments with randomly generated graphs.

abstract={The computation of generalized median graphs (the graph with the smallest average edit distance to all graphs in a given set of graphs) is highly computationally complex. As a matter of fact, it is exponential in the number of nodes of the union of all graphs under consideration. Thus, the generalized median graph computation problem seems to be a suitable and challenging testbed for a comparison of combinatorial search and genetic algorithms. Two solutions are described in this paper. The first is an exact algorithm based on combinatorial search, while the second is a genetic algorithm. Both approaches are compared to each other in a series of experiments.},

abstract={A powerful and universal data structure with applications in various subfields of science and engineering is graphs. In computer vision and image analysis, graphs are often used for the representation of structured objects. For example, if the problem is to recognize instances of known objects in an image, then often models, or prototypes, of the known objects are represented by means of graphs and stored in a database. The unknown objects in the input image are extracted by means of suitable preprocessing and segmentation algorithms, and represented by graphs that are analogous to the model graphs. Thus, the problem of object recognition is transformed into a graph matching problem. In this paper, it is assumed that there is an input graph that is given on-line, and a number of model, or prototype, graphs that are known a priori. We present a new approach to subgraph isomorphism detection which is based on a compact representation of the model graphs that is computed off-line. Subgraphs that appear multiple times within the same or within different model graphs are represented only once, thus reducing the computational effort to detect them in an input graph. In the extreme case where all model graphs are highly similar, the run time of the new algorithm becomes independent of the number of model graphs. We also describe an extension of this method to error-correcting graph matching. Furthermore, an approach to subgraph isomorphism detection based on decision trees is proposed. A decision tree is generated from the models in an off-line phase. This decision tree can be used for subgraph isomorphism detection. The time needed for decision tree traversal is only polynomial in terms of the number of nodes of the input graph. Moreover, the time complexity of the decision tree traversal is completely independent on the number of model graphs, regardless of their similarity. However, the size of the decision tree is exponential in the number of nodes of the models. To cut down the space complexity of the decision tree, some pruning strategies are discussed.},
