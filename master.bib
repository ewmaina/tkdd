 abstract= {It is shown that any recognition problem solved by a polynomial time-bounded nondeterministic Turing machine 
 can be “reduced” to the problem of determining whether a given propositional formula is a tautology. Here “reduced” means, 
 roughly speaking, that the first problem can be solved deterministically in polynomial time provided an oracle is available 
 for solving the second. From this notion of reducible, polynomial degrees of difficulty are defined, and it is shown that 
 the problem of determining tautologyhood has the same polynomial degree as the problem of determining whether the first 
 of two given graphs is isomorphic to a subgraph of the second. Other examples are discussed. A method of measuring the 
 complexity of proof procedures for the predicate calculus is introduced and discussed.}

abstract={Graphs are a powerful and universal data structure useful in various subfields of science and

a priori known model graphs to an input graph that is given online. The new approach is based on a compact 
representation of the model graphs that is computed offline. Subgraphs that appear more than once within 
the same or within different model graphs are represented only once, thus reducing the computational effort 
to detect them in an input graph. In the extreme case where all model graphs are highly similar, the run-time 
of the new algorithm becomes independent of the number of model graphs. Both a theoretical complexity analysis 
and practical experiments characterizing the performance of the new approach are given},

    for forward chaining rule-based systems. The computational complexity
    of the proposed approach is not better than that of a naive, straightforward
    solution to the problem. In the best instance, however, a significant

which contains a node for each of the unique, induced subgraphs of the database graphs. The secondary structure is a 
hash table which cross-indexes each subgraph for fast isomorphic lookup. In order to create a hash key 
independent of isomorphism, we utilize a code-based canonical representation of adjacency matrices, 
which we have further refined to improve computation speed. We validate the concept by demonstrating its effectiveness 
in answering queries for two practical datasets. Our experiments show that for subgraph isomorphism queries, 
our method outperforms existing methods by more than an order of magnitude.},

They assume that the information available in an image may be conveniently represented symbolically in a relational graph. They concentrate on the problem of matching two such graphs. First they derive a cost function associated with graph matching and more precisely associated with relational subgraph isomorphism and with maximum relational subgraph matching. This cost function is well suited for optimization methods such as simulated annealing. They show how the graph matching problem is easily cast into a simulated annealing algorithm. Finally they show some preliminary experimental results and discuss the utility of this graph matching method in computer vision in general.}

first, using a threshold for contact distance between residues; second, using Delaunay tessellation; and third,

Structural Classification of Proteins (SCOP) database, subgraph mining typically identifies several hundred 
common subgraphs corresponding to spatial motifs that are frequently found in proteins in the family but rarely 
found outside of it. We find that some of the large motifs map onto known functional regions in two protein families 
explored in this study, i.e., serine proteases and kinases. We find that graphs based on almost-Delaunay edges 
significantly reduce the number of edges in the graph representation and hence present computational advantage,

those extracted from distance based graphs. ﾂｩ Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.},

abstract={Finding recurring residue packing patterns, or spatial motifs, that characterize protein structural families 
is an important problem in bioinformatics. To this end, we apply a novel frequent subgraph mining algorithm to three 
graph representations of protein three-dimensional (3D) structure. In each protein graph, a vertex represents an amino acid. 
Vertex-residues are connected by edges using three approaches: first, based on simple distance threshold between contact residues; 
second using the Delaunay tessellation from computational geometry, and third using the recently developed almost-Delaunay tessellation 
approach. Applying this approach to a set of graphs representing a protein family from the Structural Classification of Proteins (SCOP) 
database, we typically identify several hundred common subgraphs equivalent to common packing motifs found in the majority of proteins 
in the family. We also use the counts of motifs extracted from proteins in two different SCOP families as input variables in a 
binary classification experiment using Support Vector Machines. The resulting models are capable of predicting the 
protein family association with the accuracy exceeding 90 percent. Our results indicate that graphs based on both almost-Delaunay 
and Delaunay tessellations are more sparse than contact distance graph; yet the former afford similar accuracy of classification as 
the latter. The protein graph mining and classification approaches developed in this paper can be used for rapid and automated annotation 
of protein structures determined in structural genomics projects.},

various classes of interest have many applications in pharmaceutical research and are used 
extensively at various phases during the drug development process. These techniques are used 
to solve a number of classification problems such as predicting whether or not a chemical compound 
has the desired biological activity, is toxic or nontoxic, and filtering out drug-like compounds 
from large compound libraries. This paper presents a substructure-based classification algorithm 
that decouples the substructure discovery process from the classification model construction and 
uses frequent subgraph discovery algorithms to find all topological and geometric substructures 
present in the data set. The advantage of this approach is that during classification model 
construction, all relevant substructures are available allowing the classifier to intelligently 
select the most discriminating ones. The computational scalability is ensured by the use of highly 
efficient frequent subgraph discovery algorithms coupled with aggressive feature selection. Experimental 
evaluation on eight different classification problems shows that our approach is computationally 
scalable and, on average, outperforms existing schemes by 7 percent to 35 percent.},

   abstract = {We study the problem of processing supergraph queries on graph databases. 
   A graph database D is a large set of graphs. A supergraph query q on D is to retrieve 
   all the graphs in D such that q is a supergraph of them. The large number of graphs in 
   databases and the NP-completeness of subgraph isomorphism testing make it challenging 
   to efficiently processing supergraph queries. In this paper, a new approach to processing 
   supergraph queries is proposed. Specifically, a method for compactly organizing graph 
   databases is first presented. Common subgraphs of the graphs in a database are stored 
   only once in the compact organization of the database, in order to reduce the overall 
   cost of subgraph isomorphism testings from the stored graphs to queries during query 
   processing. Then, an exact algorithm and an approximate algorithm for generating the 
   significant feature set with optimal order are proposed, followed by the algorithms 
   for indices construction on graph databases. The optimal order on the feature set is 
   to reduce the number of subgraph isomorphism testings during query processing. Based 
   on the compact organization of graph databases, a novel algorithm for testing subgraph 
   isomorphisms from multiple graphs to one graph is presented. Finally, based on all the 
   above techniques, a query processing method is proposed. Analytical and experimental 
   results show that the proposed algorithms outperform the existing similar algorithms 
   by one to two orders of magnitude.},
