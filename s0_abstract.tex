Graphs have become increasingly important structures for representing and understanding complex structures.
We propose a new method for scalably enumerating all subgraph isomorphisms of a query graph that exist in a graph database. The new approach is based on rules for efficient search of decomposed subgraphs in the database.

We start by constructing a graph database by decomposing database graphs and storing all the subgraphs at the nodes of a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG).

Using the DAG data structure we apply three rules to reduce unnecessary computation of subgraph isomorphism. First, if all the nodes in the database graph do not exist in the query then that database graph is not a subgraph of the query graph. Secondly, if any subgraph of the database graph does not exist in the query graph, the database graph is not a subgraph of the query graph. Thirdly, if a common subgraph of some database graphs does not exist in the query graph, none of the database graphs is a subgraph of the query graph. The rules are implemented as a traversal of the DAG data structure and optimized by flagging . 

We present experimental results where we compare our proposed algorithms with two well known algorithms, all isomorphism enumeration algorithm by Messmer et. al and a state of the art isomorphism detection only algorithm, VF2. Results show an order of magnitude improvement in scalability over Messmer et.al. as well as substantial improvement over the VF2 algorithm despite the increased workload of enumerating all subgraph isomorphisms. Our method is particularly suited to larger query graphs or very larger graph databases
